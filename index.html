            <p>Denmark may be a small country, but it's home to a surprising variety of wildlife. From the coastal waters to dense forests and rolling farmlands, Danish fauna has adapted to thrive in this Scandinavian landscape.</p>

                <p>Denmark's largest wild mammal, red deer can be found roaming the forests and heathlands. These majestic animals were reintroduced to Denmark in the 1960s and have since established thriving populations, particularly in Jutland.</p>
                <p>Males can weigh up to 200kg and are known for their impressive antlers and distinctive roaring calls during mating season.</p>

                <h3><span class="animal-emoji">🦎</span>Common Lizard</h3>
                <p>The only native lizard species in Denmark, these small reptiles are perfectly adapted to the Scandinavian climate. They can actually give birth to live young instead of laying eggs - a rare trait among lizards!</p>
                <p>Found basking on sunny rocks and logs, they're excellent swimmers and can even survive being frozen solid during winter.</p>

                <p>Denmark's largest bird of prey, with a wingspan reaching up to 2.5 meters! These magnificent eagles were extinct in Denmark for decades but have been successfully reintroduced and are now breeding again.</p>
                <p>They primarily hunt fish but will also take seabirds and small mammals. Their distinctive white tail feathers make them unmistakable in flight.</p>

                <p>These spiky little mammals are beloved throughout Denmark and can often be spotted in gardens and parks. They're excellent pest controllers, eating up to 200 grams of insects, worms, and slugs each night!</p>
                <p>Hedgehogs hibernate during winter, curling up into a tight ball in leaf piles or under garden sheds.</p>

                <p>After being extinct in Denmark for 200 years, wolves have naturally returned! The first wolf was spotted in 2012, and small packs now roam Jutland's forests. This marks an incredible wildlife comeback story.</p>
                <p>Danish wolves primarily hunt deer and wild boar, playing a crucial role in maintaining healthy forest ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Denmark's coastal waters are home to thousands of harbor seals, particularly in the Wadden Sea. These playful marine mammals can dive up to 90 meters deep and hold their breath for 30 minutes!</p>
                <p>Seal pups are born on sandbanks and tidal flats, and Denmark is an important breeding ground for the species in Northern Europe.</p>

                <p>They're excellent diggers and play an important role in forest ecology by turning over soil and dispersing seeds. Adult males can weigh up to 150kg!</p>

                <p>These incredible hunters primarily catch other birds in mid-flight with their razor-sharp talons.</p>
